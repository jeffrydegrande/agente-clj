- Improve the cli experience. it should look nice like bubbletea e.a. in Go. It
  should have readline support, history, and autocompletion. Maybe some clojure
  specific REPL style features. It should be easy to enable/disable
  debug/verbose output.

- Implement additional input/output mechanisms, potentially starting with slack.

- Implement MCP as an additional tool system. This must be integrated with the
  existing tool system, so that it can be used in the same way as other tools.
  It should be possible to use MCP tools in the same way as other tools, and
  they should be able to access the same data as other tools.
